# Minifier extension for TYPO3 CMS (EXT:min)

This minifier extension compresses TYPO3 frontend output in several ways:

- It minifies CSS and JS assets (TYPO3 "only" compresses them), which can save you an extra 60% of file size.
- It compresses the HTML output for each page to a single line (formerly known as ``EXT:tinysource``).

To achieve this, the great package [matthiasmullie/minify](https://github.com/matthiasmullie/minify) is used.
