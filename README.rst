TYPO3 Extension ``min``
=======================

This minifier extension compresses TYPO3 frontend output in several ways:

- It minifies CSS and JS assets (TYPO3 "only" compresses them), which can save you an extra 60% of file size.
- It compresses the HTML output for each page to a single line (formerly known as "tinysource").

To achieve this, the great package `matthiasmullie/minify <https://github.com/matthiasmullie/minify>`__ is used.
